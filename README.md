### Clustering Clients
Clustering analysis is performed using the K-Means algorithm. The notebook segments clients based on their behavior, revenue patterns, and other features. The results help identify distinct client groups.

### Correlation Analysis
A correlation analysis is conducted to identify relationships between variables. A correlation heatmap and scatter plots are used to visualize relationships within the dataset.

### Time Series Analysis
The notebook includes a comprehensive time series analysis using two different methods:

- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): This approach analyzes revenue data, identifies autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation, fits an ARIMA model, and makes revenue predictions. The process involves data differencing and model training.

- Prophet: Facebook Prophet, a time series forecasting tool, is used to predict revenue over time. It fits a time series model, makes predictions, and provides components such as yearly and weekly trends.

### Visualization
The notebook includes multiple visualizations, such as time series plots, revenue forecasts, correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and component analysis.
